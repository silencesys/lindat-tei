# Introduction

This websites should provide guidlines to help with manuscript encoding for the LINDAT/CLARIAH project. On following pages
will be discussed all important elements and best practices. In case you will have further questions, do not hesitate and
contact one of us: Lucie Doležalová, Martin Roček, Ondřej Fúsik. We will gladly help you.

Most of the descriptions are taken from the official TEI5P guidelines and because of that might not be the most descriptive ones.
Thus we will be very happy if you will have any suggestions how to improve these descriptions.
